 this project was left halfway because i found it uninteresting when i learnt that music more than 16 bot cannot be played.
<br>

well whatever happened, it happened. ill be working on the project in godot or something i guess. 


## how do i run this game?

- install [dosbox](https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1)
- open your dos box
- mount the drive you want to use in dosbox with `mount <your preffered drive name in dosbox> <your drive name in your pc where your dosbox files are>`
<br>example: `mount c c:\'
[!WARNING]
mounting dosbox in c drive is not recommended 

- `cd` to the location with `cd <location of your dos box game files`
